\section{Kickoff.ai}
\label{app:kks:kickoffai}

We built Kickoff.ai to predict football matches from the top-5 European leagues (France, Spain, Italy, England, and Germany) and two international competitions (European Championship and World Cup).
Our predictions use the Kickscore model of Chapter~\ref{ch:kickscore}.
We provide a predicted probability for the victory of Team A, of Team B, or a draw (see Figure~\ref{app:fig:kickoff-home}).
Each match has its own page, own which we display the learned latent skills of the two teams (see Figure~\ref{app:fig:kickoff-match}.
