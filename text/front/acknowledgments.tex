This thesis would not have been possible without the contributions, explicit or implicit, of many.
First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisors, Patrick Thiran and Matthias Grossglauser, for your mentorship.
You creativity, rigour, kindness, and understanding are a true inspiration.
Thank you for believing in me when I didn't.

I had the honor of having Bob West, Scott Hale, Rayid Ghani, and Karl Aberer as members of my jury committee.
Thank you for your time and your excellent comments and suggestions.
I really enjoyed discussing the five and half years of my work with you.

I have been fortunate to be surrounded by fantastic staff at the lab.
Holly Cogliati-Bauereis provided invaluable help by proof-reading and improving my manuscripts.
I became a much better writer thanks to your feedback (while having a lot of fun!).
Patricia Hjelt and Angela Devenoge assisted me with the administrative tasks---always with utmost kindness.
Marc-André Lüthi and Yves Lopes helped me with our IT infrastructure and made tuning hyperparameters of predictive models an (almost) peasant task.
I would like to thank them all.

I am very grateful to two special persons, whom I consider my academic role models.
Vincent Etter, I thank you for being an influential variable in my decision to start a Ph.D.
Since then, you have always been available to discuss my ideas and me give me honest feedback.
Lucas Maystre, I thank you for your kindness, patience, positivity, and knowledge.
I learned so much from you about so many aspects of research.
The guidance of both of you has been invaluable to the obtention of this degree.

I give as well a big thank you to my academic collaborators:
Roy Gava and Steven Eichenberger for co-organizing the AI \& Democracy conference, Marlene Kammerer and Paula Castro for our project about international climate negotiations, Corinne Straub for building the API that made Predikon a reality, Jérôme Payet, Alexis Barrou, Edouard Cattin, Blanche Dalimier, Valentin Quelquejay-Leclere, and Robin Zbinden for our joint efforts to create Climpact.

It was a joy to work with a group of smart and fun people who gave supportive advice throughout my time in the INDY Lab.

Special thank you to Batuhan, Alexander, and Aswin for being the best co-authors I could hope for.
Working with you was a pure joy and very inspiring.
Very special thank you to William for being my fellow traveller during the sinuous journey of our theses.
I will keep our coffees, beers, lunches, dinners, and discussions as some of the best memories of these years.

I am also grateful to everyone at Swiss Youth for Climate during the four years I was part of this amazing adventure.
Making the world a better place is an arduous task, but being surrounded by amazing people makes it fun.
This experience also taught me very valuable skills that I would never have learned behind my computer in the lab.
Thank you as well to everyone involved in the Divest campaign at EPFL.
I am proud that our efforts contributed to make our university more environmentally friendly.

Finally, I would like to express my deep gratitude to my family.
Thank you for your trust, understanding, and support.
The biggest thank you goes, of course, to Lydie-Line.
Your compassion, sensitivity, humour, generosity, and love make everything in life enjoyable and possible---even a Ph.D.
