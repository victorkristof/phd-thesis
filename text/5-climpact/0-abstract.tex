In this chapter\footnote{This chapter is based on \citet{kristof2019user}.}, we propose a statistical model to understand people's perception of their carbon footprint.
Our model is inspired by the probit model of~\citet{thurstone1927method} that we describe in Section~\ref{in:sec:models}.
Driven by the observation that few people think of \COtwo\ impact in absolute terms, we design a system to probe people's perception from simple pairwise comparisons of the relative carbon footprint of their actions.
The formulation of the model enables us to take an active-learning approach to selecting the pairs of actions that are maximally informative about the model parameters.
We define a set of 18 actions and collect a dataset of 2183 comparisons from 176 users on a university campus by developing a Web platform\footnote{The platform is accessible on \href{http://www.climpact.ch}{http://www.climpact.ch}.}.
The early results reveal promising directions to improve climate communication and enhance climate mitigation.
