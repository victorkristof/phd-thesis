	We propose a statistical model to understand people's perception of their carbon footprint.
	Driven by the observation that few people think of \COtwo\ impact in absolute terms, we design a system to probe people's perception from simple pairwise comparisons of the relative carbon footprint of their actions.
	The formulation of the model enables us to take an active-learning approach to selecting the pairs of actions that are maximally informative about the model parameters.
	We define a set of 18 actions and collect a dataset of 2183 comparisons from 176 users on a university campus.
	The early results reveal promising directions to improve climate communication and enhance climate mitigation.
