\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we proposed a statistical model for understanding people's global perception of their carbon footprint.
The Bayesian formulation of the model enables us to take an active-learning approach to selecting the pairs of actions that maximize the gain of information.
We deployed an online platform to collect real data from users.
The estimated perception of the users gives us insight into this population and reveals interesting directions for improving climate communication.

For future work, we will open and deploy our platform to a wider audience.
We plan to collaborate with domain experts to further analyze people's estimated perception of their carbon footprint and to translate the conclusions of the results into concrete actions.
